0.5-5
- Ironed out last warnings generated by "R CMD check coda"

0.5-4

- Provided documentation for all functions and datasets.
  (Thanks to Kurt Hornik for the prompting)

0.5-3

- Fixed bug in example for mcmc.list. Row subsetting no longer preserves
  mcmc objects (Thanks to Kurt Hornik).

0.5-2

- Fixed bug in gelman.transform which did not work for univariate chains
  (Thanks to Mark A. Beaumont)
- Fixed confidence limits in geweke.plot
  (Thanks to Mark A. Beaumont)
- Allow user to set ylim in densplot (Thanks to Niels Peter Baadsgaard)

0.5-1

- Replaced time series functions with functions from "ts" library
  (R-base >= 0.65.0)
- Removed calls to Version() (deprecated). Use is.R() instead.
- Added new function read.yesno
- Source files maintained using ESS
- Allowed restart() in codamenu.options.plot.kernel
- Simplified print.coda.options
- Removed "onepage" option in coda.options() (Subsumed in user.layout)
- Removed "mrows" and "mcols" options in coda.options (use par instead)

Changes to Geweke's diagnostic
- Uses new function spectrum0() to estimate spectral density at zero
- Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plot never discards more than half the chain
  to preserve necessary asymptotic conditions.

Changes to Gelman and Rubin's diagnostic
- Multivariate psrf added.
- Documentation for Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plot update to give
  clearer motivation.

Changes to Heidelberger and Welch's diagnostic
- Simplified formula for Cramer-von Mises statistic
- Using new function spectrum0() to estimate spectral density at zero
- Can set p-value threshold for passing convergence test.
- p-value is printed in output, using new function pcramer().
- Prints starting iteration of truncated chain instead of number
  of iterations to discard.

0.4-7

Fixed bug in read.bugs.interactive() leading to failure when
user enters both ".ind" and ".out" names (Thanks to John Logsdon).

0.4-6

Archive 0.4-5 was incorrectly compressed with "compress" instead
of "gzip". Corrected by Friedrich Leisch.

0.4-5

Bug fixes
- densplot failed with show.obs=TRUE when scale was "positive" or
  "proportion".
- as.matrix.mcmc failed to preserve start, end and thin.
- codamenu did not tidy up on exit.

0.4-4

Started S3 compatibility
Fixed bug which caused options menus to crash
Fixed legend bug in gelman.plot
Confirmed that these bugs are fixed:
* densplot "missing" and "scale" bugs (Thanks to Greg Warnes)
* autocorr "improper time series parameters" bug ("acf"
  function rewritten by Paul Gilbert)
* integer overflow bug in raftery.diag (Thanks to Morten
  Frydenberg)
* read.bugs.interactive will search for the files it needs
  and print their names.
codamenu now assigns default variable and chain names to
data when these are NULL.

0.4-3

Fixed help page errors pointed out by Brian Ripley.
Fixed coda.credits

0.4-2

Whoops. 0.4-1 was a mistake.

0.4-1

updated manual pages
new class mcmc.list added to deal with multiple chains. ugrade.mcmc
   function introduced to deal with old mcmc objects.
plot functions changed to use the "ask" parameter instead of
  "pause" functions.
spec.pgram now handles matrix time-series.
acf function now calculates cross-correlations. Thanks to Paul Gilbert.
codamenu functions now use title argument in "menu"
corrected spelling mistakes in help pages
changed instances of "T" and "F" to "TRUE" and "FALSE" (R coding standards)
densplot now recognizes discrete distributions and prints histogram ...
... also prints histogram if IQR=0 (large mass on one point)
fixed bug in mcmc which allowed non-integer thinning intervals
Fixed manual pages with bad use of "alias" command.

0.3-4

Fixed bug in "tspar<-" which breaks much of the code in R-0.62

0.3-3

Package was in obsolete format. Corrected by Fritz.

** Pre-release changes for R version

Created class "mcmc" with associated constructor and extractor
functions as well as plot, print and summary methods.

Modified diagnostics so they all work on objects of class "mcmc"
and can be called directly by the user. All diagnostics return
objects with associated print methods. Renamed some functions
and arguments for ease of use.

Changed the menu driven interface - now called by the function
"codamenu" - to avoid recursive calling of menu functions.

Put frequently used code inside utility functions.

Got rid of functions written by Mathsoft

Wrote drop-in replacements for some time series functions which
are found in S-PLUS but not R.

The logfile facility has been removed. Sorry.

Changed license terms to GPL.
