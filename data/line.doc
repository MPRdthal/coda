Line - Line example from BUGS manual

DESCRIPTION

A simple linear regression example used to illustrate the BUGS software
for Gibbs Sampling.

FORMAT

An mcmc.list object with 200 iterations, 3 variables and 2 chains.
The variables are

alpha	Intercept parameter
beta	Slope parameter
sigma	Variance parameter

The chains are

line1
line2

The chains were generated using BUGS 0.6 with the following starting
values, taken from the manual for CODA version 0.3.

chain1: list(tau = 5, alpha = -5, beta=5, seed=1286608618)
chain2: list(tau = 0.01, alpha = 0.01, beta=0.01, seed=1234567890)

Note that in the CODA manual, for version 0.3, the seed for the
first chain is given as 9876543210. In bugs 0.6 this causes a stack
overflow error, because only 4 bytes of storage are set aside for
the random seed. The value given for the seed here is 9876543210 %% 2^32.
